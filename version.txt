Current version 3.4.4

3.4.4   *) Adding support for multiple proxy protocols in config.xml as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/23#issuecomment-40173913

           Example proxy xml declaration:
           <proxy protocols="http,https" url="218.204.159.45:8123" login="John Smith" password="xxx" />

3.4.3   *) Adding explicit protocol support through config.xml as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/23#issuecomment-40054238

3.4.2   *) Reverting 3.3.1 change as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/27

3.4.1   +) Fixed urllib2.build_opener() call as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/26#issuecomment-40053091

3.4     +) Added authentication support for proxy as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/26

3.3.2   +) Added explicit urllib2.HTTPSHandler() to urllib2.opener as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/23#issuecomment-39948409

3.3.1   *) pkg/bingHistory.getBingHistoryTodayURL() is now calculating time in PST time zone.
           The change was made after adding HTTP proxy support as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/23
           localtime was no longer accurate.

3.3     +) Adding HTTP proxy support as per
           https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/23

           new XML node under <configuration> -> <proxy url="ip:port">. Can be also <proxy url="url:port">

3.2     +) "User-Agent" HTTP header from a predefined list of most commonly used user agents.
           A new user agent is chosen for each account at random. All searches on one account use the same user agent.
           Looks like it solves the problem discussed here https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/17

        *) Changed
           BING_QUERY_SUCCESSFULL_RESULT_MARKER = '<div id="results_container">'
           to
           BING_QUERY_SUCCESSFULL_RESULT_MARKER = '<div id="b_content">'

3.1.6   *) Case insensitive match on flyout strings. Bing! changed "Search and Earn" to "Search and earn"

3.1.5   *) Fixed Live auth. Credits to jbrobst (GitHub). https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/18

3.1.4   *) Fixed a bug in lifetime credits parser. https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/13

3.1.3   *) As per https://github.com/sealemar/BingRewards/issues/13 - Bing! Dashboard HTML was changed. This fix accounts for the change.

3.1.2   *) Increased intervals in config.xml. It looks like Bing! black lists an IP if it abuses with frequent requests.

3.1.1   *) Bing! authentication URL both for LiveId and Facebook now contains escape characters (http:// is http\x3a\x2f\x2f, for example). Those need to be converted back to normal URL. See [http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#python-specific-encodings]
        +) Script current version date is now outputed with "--version" argument

3.1     +) config.xml - general.betweenAccountsInterval and general.betweenAccountsSalt - time to sleep between two accounts - not to annoy Bing!

3.0.3   *) commenting the referer in BingFlyoutParser, because on 10/25/2013 Bing! started to return an empty flyout page if referer is other than http://www.bing.com

3.0.2   *) the script now looks for default config.xml in the directory where it is located
        *) "pkg" project subfolder is now searched under the script directory

3.0.1   *) pkg/helpers.py - xml.etree.ElementTree.getChildren() -> xml.etree.ElementTree.getchildren()
           typo in method name for Python < 2.7

3.0     +) events support in config.xml to automize retries and notifications based on optional conditions
        +) new section in config.xml - <general betweenQueriesInterval="2.0" betweenQueriesSalt="3.0" />
        +) --version - outputs version information
        +) test/ut_config.py - unit tests config.xml parsing
        *) project's folder structure redesigned:
            /       - main.py and config.xml
            pkg/    - all the rest of the code
            notify/ - notification scripts
            test/   - unit tests
            results/ -> result/ - script results and errors


2.9.1   *) Fixed bug with reporting zero total points

2.9     +) Full report added. Script options [-r, --full-report].
           Report is automatically triggered if more than one account was processed and cumulative points earned was more than zero.

2.8     *) Live auth sso parameter is now not converted to int, because it can be 'false' which is not casted automatically

        +) .gitignore - ignore *.swp which vim spams with


2.7     +) Lifetime Credits output for every account

2.6     *) in case of several accounts and one of the first accounts processing fails with exception, script doesn't crashes, but continues for all of the rest accounts

2.5     *) fixed crash in bingQueriesGenerator.py - changed the format of startMarker and endMarker of newsPage

2.4     +) main.py - total points earned during the session is now printed out when the script finishes

2.3     *) bingQueriesGenerator - changed parsing HTML tag to comply with new Bing! output

2.2     +) bingFlyoutParser now understands descriptions
        +) bingFlyoutParser + Reward.Action.PASS for 'Silver Status' and for 'Get the best of Bing by signing in with Facebook.' description
        +) bingRewards.printResults() now prints errors if verbose mode is off

2.1     +) main.py is now explicitly marked as a python script
        *) chmod 644 bingRewards.py
        *) chmod 755 main.py

2.0     +) Live authentication supported
        *) The script is now executed with
           python main.py
           See `python main.py -h` to understand how the script can be used
        *) Authentication configuration moved to config.xml. No direct script changes to use different account information are needed.
           config.xml accepts Live and Facebook authentication types. Any number of authentications can be added to config.xml.

1.4     Bing! rewards page changed. Bing! flyout is now requested with http://www.bing.com/rewards/dashboard in a Referer header, otherwise it is empty

1.3     Don't raise exception if history page is empty - warn instead.
        added to bingRewards.py:
        from __future__ import with_statement

1.2     Configurable salt to sleep between requests

1.1     Bing! news changed the output format for tag <span class="sn_snip">. This version works both with the former and the latter behavior

1.0     First implementation plus whatever was else before I created this file :)
